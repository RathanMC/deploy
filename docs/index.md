# Welcome to My Dummy Site

This is a simple MkDocs site deployed using GitHub Actions.

## About This Project
This project demonstrates how to:
- Create a static documentation site using MkDocs.
- Automate build and deployment with GitHub Actions.
- Host the site on GitHub Pages.

## Why MkDocs?
MkDocs is a fast, simple, and beautiful static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. It uses Markdown files for content and a YAML configuration for navigation.

## Features
- **Easy Setup**: Just write Markdown files.
- **Custom Themes**: Choose from built-in themes or create your own.
- **GitHub Pages Integration**: Deploy your site automatically.

## How It Works
1. Write your documentation in Markdown.
2. Configure navigation in `mkdocs.yml`.
3. Push changes to GitHub.
4. GitHub Actions builds and deploys your site to GitHub Pages.

## Next Steps
- Add more pages under the `docs/` folder.
- Customize the theme in `mkdocs.yml`.
- Add a custom domain for your site.

Would you like me to also **create additional pages** like:
- `getting-started.md` (how to set up MkDocs)
- `workflow-guide.md` (explaining the GitHub Actions workflow)
- `custom-domain.md` (steps for adding a custom domain)
